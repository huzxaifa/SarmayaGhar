1. Necessary User Inputs

For your AI-powered valuation web app, the goal is:
  ->  The user provides a few high-impact inputs → system maps them to dataset features → ML model predicts property value and related insights.

Here are the necessary and most influential inputs :
Location, Property Type, Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Purpose, Year Built (optional), Key Features (checkbox list)
From these, your backend extracts, transforms, and maps to dataset features for prediction.

2. Data Preprocessing & Transformation Pipeline

Let’s break down exactly what happens between user input → model prediction.

Step-by-Step Data Flow

Step 1: Input Parsing & Validation
User fills in the form (location, area, etc.).
Backend validates: e.g., area > 0, built in year .
Converts units if needed (e.g., 10 marla → 2250 sq ft).

Step 2: Feature Mapping & Enrichment

The system looks up historical data for the same or nearby locations.
It fetches average price per marla, market trend indicators, and comparable property features (comps).

Example:
“10 Marla House in LDA Avenue, Lahore” → mean price/marla = PKR 32.5 lakh.
This ensures the model has contextual (spatial + temporal) data.

Step 3: Data Cleaning

Before training or predicting:
Handle missing values (NaN for features like community or amenities).
→ Replace with defaults or neighborhood averages.
Remove duplicates and invalid records.
Standardize categorical labels (e.g., “House” vs “house”).

Step 4: Feature Engineering

Here’s where the magic happens — converting raw fields into machine-readable features.
| Raw Field    |    Engineered Feature  |    Description  |
| `Price`     | `price_per_marla` = Price / Area  | Normalized metric   |
| `Location`  | Lat/Long embedding / one-hot encoding | Spatial representation  |
| `Date Added`   | `Property Age` / `Season Index` | Temporal influence  |
| `Features`     | Count or binary vector | e.g., has_garage = 1  |
| `Market Trend` | Rising / Falling / Stable   | Derived via time-series analysis |
Step 5: Feature Selection & Normalization

Select only the model’s input features (e.g., top 20 by correlation or feature importance).

Normalize values (MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler) to avoid bias from large numeric ranges.

Step 6: Model Inference (Prediction)

Feed transformed vector → trained ML models:

Linear Regression: for interpretability

Random Forest / XGBoost: for robustness

Deep Neural Networks: for non-linear feature learning

Model Outputs:
Predicted Price = 3.25 Crore
Confidence = 87%
Market Trend = Rising
Price/Marla = PKR 32.5 Lakh
Projected Value after 1 year = 3.45 Crore
