⚙️ 2. Data Preprocessing & Transformation Pipeline

Let’s break down exactly what happens between user input → model prediction.

Step-by-Step Data Flow
🧭 Step 1: Input Parsing & Validation

User fills in the form (location, area, etc.).

Backend validates: e.g., area > 0, location exists in database, purpose ∈ {Sale, Rent}.

Converts units if needed (e.g., 10 marla → 2250 sq ft).

🧮 Step 2: Feature Mapping & Enrichment

The system looks up historical data for the same or nearby locations.

It fetches average price per marla, market trend indicators, and comparable property features (comps).

Example:

“10 Marla House in LDA Avenue, Lahore” → mean price/marla = PKR 32.5 lakh.

This ensures the model has contextual (spatial + temporal) data.

🧹 Step 3: Data Cleaning

Before training or predicting:

Handle missing values (NaN for features like community or amenities).
→ Replace with defaults or neighborhood averages.

Remove duplicates and invalid records.

Standardize categorical labels (e.g., “House” vs “house”).

⚖️ Step 4: Feature Engineering

Here’s where the magic happens — converting raw fields into machine-readable features.

Examples:

Raw Field	Engineered Feature	Description
Price	price_per_marla = Price / Area	Normalized metric
Location	Lat/Long embedding / one-hot encoding	Spatial representation
Date Added	Property Age / Season Index	Temporal influence
Features	Count or binary vector	e.g., has_garage = 1
Market Trend	Rising / Falling / Stable	Derived via time-series analysis

Other techniques:

Log-scaling for skewed variables (like price)

Encoding text-based features (like amenities)

Interaction terms (e.g., Area × Location_Premium)

📊 Step 5: Feature Selection & Normalization

Select only the model’s input features (e.g., top 20 by correlation or feature importance).

Normalize values (MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler) to avoid bias from large numeric ranges.

🤖 Step 6: Model Inference (Prediction)

Feed transformed vector → trained ML models:

Linear Regression: for interpretability

Random Forest / XGBoost: for robustness

Deep Neural Networks: for non-linear feature learning

Model outputs:

Predicted Price = 3.25 Crore
Confidence = 87%
Market Trend = Rising
Price/Marla = PKR 32.5 Lakh
Projected Value after 1 year = 3.45 Crore

📈 Step 7: Post-Processing & Result Display

Results are formatted for UI display.

Backend can also save predictions for analytics or retraining.
