- **Technologies**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Data Sources**: Processed datasets from Zameen.com and Graana.com

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Frontend Deployment
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd /home/ubuntu/sarmayaghar/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the production version:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. The build files will be in the `build` directory, ready to be served by any static file server.

### Backend Deployment
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd /home/ubuntu/sarmayaghar/backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure the ML models are in the correct location:
   ```
   mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/models
   cp /path/to/models/*.pkl /home/ubuntu/models/
   ```

5. Start the Flask server:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

6. The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Future Enhancements

### Pending Features
1. **User Authentication**: Implement user registration, login, and profile management
2. **Third-Party Integrations**: Add payment gateways, Google Maps integration, etc.
3. **Mobile App**: Develop a companion mobile application

### ML Model Improvements
1. Enhance Rental Yield model with additional training data
2. Implement periodic retraining pipeline for models
3. Add more sophisticated location-based features

## Testing Results
All core features have been tested and validated. Please refer to the detailed testing report for comprehensive test results and performance metrics.

## Conclusion
The SarmayaGhar application has successfully implemented all core features as specified in the requirements. The machine learning models are performing well and are properly integrated into the application. The user interface follows the Figma design specifications and provides a seamless experience across devices.

The application is ready for deployment with the understanding that user authentication and third-party integrations will be implemented in a future update.
