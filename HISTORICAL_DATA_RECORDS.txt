================================================================================

FALLBACK MECHANISM TRIGGERS:
============================

The system uses fallback formula (15.6578% property appreciation, 0.4897% rent growth)
when historical data meets any of these criteria:

1. No Historical Data Available
   - Location/property type combination not found in database
   - Fallback Reason: "no_historical_data"

2. Severely Negative Appreciation
   - Historical property appreciation < -20%
   - Fallback Reason: "negative_appreciation_too_severe"
   - Examples: Abdullahpur (-55.78%), Afghanabad (-33.66%), Air Avenue City (-24.62%)

3. Severely Negative Rent Growth
   - Historical rent growth < -10%
   - Fallback Reason: "negative_rent_growth_too_severe"

4. Low Confidence Data
   - Historical data confidence ≤ 0.6
   - Fallback Reason: "low_confidence_data"
   - Examples: Al Barkat Villas (0.527), Al Noor Garden Lower Portion (0.527)

5. Extreme Positive Appreciation
   - Very high appreciation rates with low confidence
   - May trigger fallback due to unreliability

================================================================================
