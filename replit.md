SarmayaGhar is an AI-powered real estate investment platform specifically designed for the Pakistani market. The application provides intelligent property valuation, market analysis, portfolio management, and investment insights using machine learning models. It integrates React frontend with Express/Node.js backend, featuring property listings, AI chatbot assistance, interactive heatmaps, and comprehensive investment analytics.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client application is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing a component-based architecture with shadcn/ui for consistent design patterns. The UI follows the "new-york" style variant with Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design. Key architectural decisions include:

- **State Management**: Uses React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state management and caching, with React hooks for local state
- **Routing**: Implements wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: Leverages react-hook-form with Zod validation for type-safe form management
- **Component Structure**: Organized with reusable UI components in /components/ui and feature-specific components at the root level
- **Data Visualization**: Integrates Chart.js for property analytics and portfolio visualization

## Backend Architecture
The server follows an Express.js architecture with TypeScript, implementing RESTful API patterns:

- **API Design**: Centralized route registration with middleware for logging and error handling
- **Data Layer**: Uses in-memory storage (MemStorage) as the primary data store with interfaces designed for easy database migration
- **ML Integration**: Simulates machine learning models for property valuation, market predictions, and ROI calculations
- **AI Services**: Integrates OpenAI GPT-5 for chatbot functionality and market analysis

## Database Design
Currently uses in-memory storage with a schema defined for PostgreSQL migration:

- **Schema Management**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript for type-safe database operations
- **Data Models**: Comprehensive schemas for properties, valuations, portfolio tracking, and chat messages
- **Migration Ready**: Configured for PostgreSQL with Neon Database serverless connection

## Authentication & Session Management
The application includes session management infrastructure:

- **Session Storage**: Configured for PostgreSQL session storage using connect-pg-simple
- **Security**: Implements proper CORS and session handling middleware

# External Dependencies

## Database Services
- **Neon Database**: PostgreSQL serverless database with connection pooling
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database toolkit for PostgreSQL operations

## AI & Machine Learning

### Core ML System
The application features a comprehensive machine learning training pipeline for property valuation:

**ML Models Implemented:**
- Linear Regression (TensorFlow.js)
- Decision Tree Regressor (custom implementation)
- Random Forest Regressor (ensemble method)
- Gradient Boosting Regressor (boosting algorithm)
- XGBoost Regressor (advanced boosting with regularization)
- Deep Learning (4-layer feedforward neural network)

**Training Pipeline (`server/ml/`):**
- `dataProcessor.ts`: Data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling
- `models.ts`: All 6 ML model implementations with training & evaluation
- `trainingService.ts`: Training orchestration, model management, and prediction

**Dataset:**
- Source: `attached_assets/zameen-updated_1757269388792.csv` (48MB, 168K+ records)
- Features: 16 engineered features including location encoding, price per unit, property age, etc.
- Preprocessing: Outlier removal, feature scaling (z-score normalization), label encoding

**Model Evaluation Metrics:**
- R² Score (Coefficient of determination)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

**Model Storage:**
- Format: TensorFlow.js (model.json + weights.bin for DL models)
- Location: `trained_models/<model_name>/`
- Metadata: Each model includes metadata.json with performance metrics and hyperparameters

**Training API:**
- `POST /api/ml/train-models` - Train all missing models
- `GET /api/ml/model-status` - Check which models are trained
- `GET /api/ml/training-status` - Real-time training status
- `POST /api/ml/property-valuation` - Get AI-powered property valuations

**How to Train Models:**
1. Navigate to the AI Valuation page in the UI
2. Click the "Train Models" button (if models not trained)
3. Or use API: `curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ml/train-models`
4. Training outputs performance comparison of all models
5. System automatically selects best model based on R² score

**Feature Engineering:**
- Categorical encoding for property type, location, city, province
- Location premium calculation from historical prices
- Property age from date added
- Bath-to-bedroom ratio
- Normalized area size
- Price per unit calculation

**Prediction Flow:**
1. User inputs property details
2. System converts to engineered features
3. Applies saved scaling parameters
4. Makes prediction using best trained model
5. Returns price, confidence score, range, insights, and market trends

### Other AI Services
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-5 integration for chatbot functionality and market analysis
- **TensorFlow.js**: Browser/Node.js ML framework for model training and inference
- **Chart.js**: Client-side data visualization for property analytics

## UI & Styling
- **shadcn/ui**: Component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives for complex UI patterns

## Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server with React plugin
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across frontend and backend
- **Replit Integration**: Development environment with cartographer and error overlay plugins

## Pakistani Market Specific
- **Currency**: PKR formatting and Pakistani city/area databases
- **Property Types**: Local property categories (marla, kanal measurements)
- **Market Data**: Simulated ML models for Pakistani real estate trends
